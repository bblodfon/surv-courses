Radiation doses have been estimated for $1022$ women who received radiation exposure to the chest from X-ray fluoroscopy lung examinations. Some women had multiple exposures to radiation. The remaining $698$ women in the cohort received treatments that did not require fluoroscopic monitoring and were radiation unexposed. The patients had been followed up until the end of 1980, by which time $75$ breast cancer cases were observed. (Source: Hrubec et al., Cancer Research, 1989)\n\nFor this cohort radiation data have been collected for all $1720$ women. **But the workload of exposure data collection would have been reduced if the investigators had used a cohort sampling design**. In this exercise we will look at estimation based on the full cohort and for nested case-control and case-cohort samples selected from the full cohort.\n\nWe first look at the cohort data.
